# Loop_selector


For any input .pdb file, the program will extract loop area of this protein utilizing pyrosetta loop selector funciton, and calculate the related information using GOR4 method, and storge in an excel file

This can help to select loop area of a natural protein as protein linker design


Usage:

1. change the runpath in pdb_scan.py to the file with all protein needed to be extract
2. Then the program will run the loop_selector.py to extract loop area of all the protien and store all the information collected in an excel file
